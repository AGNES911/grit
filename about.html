      <p class="zero">
        I am a communications graduate with solid experience in customer
        service,<br />
        sales leadership, and public relations. Having worked with Gtel and<br />
        currently at Safaricom, I have managed sales teams, introduced<br />
        customer-centric innovations, and handled high volumes of customer<br />
        interactions—up to 160 clients daily. One of my proudest achievements
        was<br />
        developing a “Lipa Mdogo Mdogo” solution that increased sales from 15%
        to<br />
        50%, showcasing my ability to use creative thinking and data insights
        to<br />
        drive growth. My daily engagement with customers has fueled my interest
        in<br />
        Data Science—particularly how it can help solve real-world problems,<br />
        enhance service delivery, and inform business strategy. I am
        currently<br />
        exploring opportunities in the telecom sector where I can apply data<br />
        science to create smarter, customer-focused solutions.<br />
